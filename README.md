qtt-laplace
===========
A library for solving an elliptic differential equation in 2D using Finite Element Method (FEM) and Quantized Tensor Train (QTT) decomposition.

This library uses a special operation Z-kron to avoid approximation ranks growing in the QTT-format. 
This operation enables to build a matrix in the QTT-format with special rows and columns ordering -- z-order. 
As a result, this approach has slow approximation ranks growing and consumes much less memory than FEniCS.

The left plot is an energy error from vertices number. 
The middle plot is a erank growing from approximation accuracy. 
The right plot is a peak memory consumption from vertices number.
